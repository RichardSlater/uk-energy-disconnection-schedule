In November 2019 The UK Department For Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy has released the [Electricity Supply Emergency Code (ESEC)](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/electricity-supply-emergency-code) which proposes a series of planned weekly power outages to help the country maintain a stable energy network.

This document sets out a series of levels from 1 to 18 depending upon the need. Level 1 would mean each customer would be disconnected from the energy network for about 9 hours every week on a fixed schedule. At level 18 all customers would be disconnected 24/7, at this stage it isn't even certain this plan will be put into place and it is very unlikely we will ever need the higher levels.

The whole network will not be shut down at the same time, it is split into 18 parts - at level 1 this means rougly 6% of the network will be disconnected for 3 hours at a time.

What I've done in these pages is to try and represent this data in a way that is easy for individuals to consume.
